This is my GitHub repository for the [WordPress for Developers course at SoftUni] (https://softuni.bg/trainings/4782/wordpress-for-developers-october-2024).

I am using a [static HTML template] (https://themewagon.com/themes/teahouse/) to convert it into a dynamic WordPress theme, with the help of a few custom plugins.
